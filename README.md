CertiÐApp is a digital certificate issuer, powered on blockchain. On
CertiÐApp organizations can issue certificates to their users over blockchain making these
certificates immutable and temper-proof. It uses an advanced technique called ECDSA  to
verify certificate data on Blockchain

> CertiDApp utilizes Elliptic Curve cryptography and Ethereum Blockchain’s immutability, IPFS decentralized file storage to feature transparent verification of certificates.

## How Secure CertiDApp is : 
> Certificates on certiDApp is completly stored on decentralized network that's why certificates are Durable, Reliable & Secured


## Features

* CertiÐApp uses an advanced technique called ECDSA to sign certificate data on Blockchain. This let’s certificate issuers include any kind of data in the certificate
* CertiÐApp solves the authenticity-related problems using Kerckhoff's Principle of Cryptography. Here, instead of traditionally having complicated and secret certificate printing process, we use a publicly known secure Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) which is used in SSL.
* CertiÐApp certificates support Multiple Signatures, which means that multiple certifying authorities can sign on one certificate.
* Customizable certificates as per your requirement, with a feature of adding multiple signatures
* No certificate issuing fees charged on CertiÐApp to certifying authority
* Your certificate gets stored on Highly Decentralized Secured Eraswap Blockchain
